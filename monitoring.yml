# This is a demo for Ansible playbooks
# http://ansible.github.com
# 
# this demo playbook is for CentOS6 + EPEL
# it could configure yum.repos.d via templates
# but didn't want to reconfigure any system
# you might run it on without asking.

# Configure all hosts to be monitored

# in that list)

- hosts: nodes;ganglia.example.com
  user: root
  tasks:
     # what roles to apply?
     - include: tasks/common.yml

     - include: handlers/handlers.yml

############################################################
# Configure the monitoring server.  Note that this assumes
# CentOS 6 with EPEL configured.  Ansible can obviously
# configure yum.repos.d but this is left off to keep
# the example short.

- hosts: ganglia.example.com
  user: root
  vars:
     # ganglia requires a node running gmetad to talk to.
